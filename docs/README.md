# GitHub GraphQL Go documentation


## Features

- This tool is a light wrapper on the [githubv4](https://github.com/shurcooL/githubv4) Go library.
- The idea is to make a simple CLI tool. It expects a GraphQL query given on a filepath and output JSON data to a target path.
- This can be distributed as compiled binary. No Go coding experience needed. No need to setup your environment and packages, like for equivalent Ruby/Python/JS projects.
- You can download and run this tool as part of a build pipeline in your projects. Or run it as a standalone tool.
